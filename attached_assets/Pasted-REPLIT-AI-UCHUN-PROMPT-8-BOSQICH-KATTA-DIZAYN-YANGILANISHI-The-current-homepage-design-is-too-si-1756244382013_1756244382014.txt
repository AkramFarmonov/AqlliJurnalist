REPLIT AI UCHUN PROMPT (8-BOSQICH - KATTA DIZAYN YANGILANISHI)
The current homepage design is too simple. Your task is to overhaul the UI to make it look and feel like a dynamic, professional news portal, similar to major news websites. Perform the following three major changes.

Implement a CSS Grid Layout for Articles:

In the client/src/pages/home.tsx file, locate the section where the list of articles is rendered.

Replace the current single-column layout with a responsive multi-column CSS Grid.

The grid should have 3 columns on desktop screens (lg breakpoints and up).

It should adapt to 2 columns on tablet-sized screens (md breakpoints).

It should be a single column on mobile screens (sm breakpoints).

Ensure there is a consistent gap between grid items (e.g., gap-4 or gap-6).

Enhance the ArticleCard Component:

Open the client/src/components/news/article-card.tsx file.

Typography: Increase the font size and font weight of the article title to make it more prominent and attention-grabbing (e.g., text-xl font-bold).

Metadata: Make the metadata line (category and timestamp) more distinct. You can use a smaller font size and a secondary text color (e.g., text-sm text-muted-foreground).

Interaction Icons: The views/comments/shares icons at the bottom of the card are currently too small. Increase their size and add a small label or use more visually distinct icons from the lucide-react library.

Create and Add a "Breaking News" Ticker:

Create a new component file at client/src/components/news/breaking-news-ticker.tsx.

Inside this component, use useQuery to fetch the 3 most recent articles from the API.

The component should render a container with a distinct background color (e.g., bg-red-600 or dark:bg-zinc-800).

Inside the container, display a static "So'nggi Yangiliklar:" label.

Next to the label, display the titles of the 3 fetched articles, ideally in a looping horizontal scroll or carousel effect.

Finally, import and place this new <BreakingNewsTicker /> component into the home.tsx page, right below the main hero section and above the category filters.

After implementing all three changes, confirm by stating: "Homepage UI has been overhauled with a dynamic grid layout, enhanced article cards, and a new breaking news ticker."
