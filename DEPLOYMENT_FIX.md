# Deployment Fix for Render.com

## Issue
Render.com deployment fails with "Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react'" error because essential build-time packages are in devDependencies instead of dependencies.

## Solution
Before pushing to GitHub, you need to move these packages from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in package.json:

### Packages to Move:
```json
"@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.2",
"autoprefixer": "^10.4.20", 
"postcss": "^8.4.47",
"tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
"typescript": "5.6.3",
"vite": "^5.4.19"
```

### Steps to Fix:
1. Download or clone this project to your local machine
2. Open `package.json` in a text editor
3. Move the above packages from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` section
4. Run `npm install` locally to update package-lock.json
5. Commit and push changes to GitHub
6. Redeploy on Render.com

### Why This Happens:
- Render.com only installs `dependencies` in production builds
- Build tools like Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind are needed during the build process
- These packages must be in `dependencies` for deployment platforms

### After Fix:
The deployment should work successfully with the build command:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

This is a common requirement for production deployments and not an error in the project setup.
